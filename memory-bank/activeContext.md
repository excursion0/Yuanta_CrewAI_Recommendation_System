# Active Context: Financial Product Recommendation Chatbot

## Current Focus
Planning phase for Level 4 complex system implementation of agent-based financial product recommendation chatbot using CrewAI framework.

## Key Requirements
- CrewAI as main orchestration framework
- Integration with Pydantic for data validation
- GraphRAG for enhanced retrieval capabilities
- Multiple data sources (sparse search, dense search, structured DB, knowledge graph)
- User memory and context management
- LLM-based response generation

## Architecture Overview
Based on the provided RAG system diagram, implementing:
1. User Interaction Layer
2. Memory Context Layer  
3. Orchestration Layer (Query Orchestrator, Intent Analysis, Tool Selector)
4. Retrieval Layer (Multiple search mechanisms)
5. Fusion Layer (Result merging and ranking)
6. Generation Layer (LLM-based response generation)
7. Response Layer (Answer/recommendation delivery)

## Current Phase
- Status: Planning Phase
- Next: Technology validation and creative phases
- Priority: Comprehensive architectural planning for Level 4 system
