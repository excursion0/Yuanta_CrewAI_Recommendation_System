# Project Brief: Financial Product Recommendation Chatbot

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive agent-based financial product recommendation chatbot solution using CrewAI as the main framework. The system will integrate multiple components including Pydantic for data validation, GraphRAG for enhanced retrieval capabilities, and various data sources for comprehensive financial product recommendations.

## Business Objectives
- Provide personalized financial product recommendations based on user profiles and preferences
- Enable natural language interaction for financial product queries
- Integrate multiple data sources for comprehensive product information
- Ensure high accuracy and relevance in recommendations
- Support scalable architecture for future enhancements

## Key Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Financial product seekers requiring personalized recommendations
- **Financial Institutions**: Product providers needing effective distribution channels
- **System Administrators**: Technical staff managing and monitoring the system
- **Business Analysts**: Teams analyzing recommendation effectiveness and user behavior

## Success Criteria
- Response time under 3 seconds for recommendation queries
- 95%+ accuracy in product recommendation relevance
- Support for multiple financial product categories
- Scalable architecture supporting 10,000+ concurrent users
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: CrewAI (Main orchestration framework)
- **Language**: Python 3.12.5
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Retrieval Enhancement**: GraphRAG
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI/Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Build Tool**: pip

## Architecture Vision
The system follows a multi-layered RAG architecture with agent-based orchestration:
1. **User Interaction Layer**: Query input and context management
2. **Memory Context Layer**: Conversation history and user profiles
3. **Orchestration Layer**: Query orchestrator, intent analysis, tool selector
4. **Retrieval Layer**: Multiple search mechanisms (sparse, dense, structured, graph)
5. **Fusion Layer**: Result merging and ranking
6. **Generation Layer**: LLM-based response generation
7. **Response Layer**: Answer/recommendation delivery

## Current Status
-  Technology validation completed
-  Core dependencies installed and tested
-  Planning phase in progress
-  Creative phases pending
