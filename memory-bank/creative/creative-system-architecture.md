# ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

## Context and Problem Statement

The financial product recommendation chatbot requires a robust, scalable architecture that can handle multiple data sources, complex agent interactions, and real-time user queries while maintaining high accuracy and performance. The system must integrate CrewAI for agent orchestration, GraphRAG for enhanced retrieval, and Anthropic as the primary LLM provider.

### System Requirements
- Multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI
- Multi-source data retrieval (sparse, dense, structured, graph)
- Real-time response generation with Anthropic Claude
- Scalable architecture supporting 10,000+ concurrent users
- High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Secure data handling for financial information
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.12.5 as primary language
- CrewAI framework for agent management
- Anthropic Claude as primary LLM
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Neo4j for knowledge graph (GraphRAG)

## Architecture Options Analysis

### Option 1: Layered Microservices Architecture

**Description**: Traditional microservices approach with clear layer separation and service boundaries.

- Independent scaling of components
- Technology diversity per service
- Fault isolation
- Easy to test individual services

**Cons**:
- Increased complexity in service coordination
- Network latency between services
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Higher operational overhead
- Potential data consistency challenges

**Technical Fit**: High
**Complexity**: High
**Scalability**: High

### Option 2: Event-Driven Architecture with CrewAI Orchestration

**Description**: Event-driven system with CrewAI as the central orchestrator, using message queues for communication.

**Pros**:
- Loose coupling between components
- Excellent scalability for high-volume processing
- Natural fit for CrewAI's agent-based approach
- Easy to add new data sources
- Built-in fault tolerance

**Cons**:
- Complex event ordering and consistency
- Debugging and tracing challenges
- Potential message loss scenarios
- Higher latency for synchronous operations

**Technical Fit**: Very High
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Scalability**: Very High

### Option 3: Modular Monolith with CrewAI Integration

**Description**: Single application with modular internal structure, using CrewAI for agent management within the monolith.

**Pros**:
- Simpler deployment and monitoring
- Lower latency for internal operations
- Easier debugging and development
- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- Better data consistency

**Cons**:
- Limited independent scaling
- Technology lock-in
- Potential for tight coupling
- Single point of failure risk

**Technical Fit**: Medium
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Scalability**: Medium

## Decision

**Chosen Option**: Option 2 - Event-Driven Architecture with CrewAI Orchestration

**Rationale**:
1. **Perfect CrewAI Integration**: Event-driven architecture naturally complements CrewAI's agent-based approach, allowing agents to respond to events and publish results asynchronously.

2. **Scalability for Financial Domain**: Financial product queries can have high volume and varying complexity. Event-driven architecture allows for dynamic scaling based on load.

3. **Multi-Source Data Integration**: The system needs to integrate multiple data sources (sparse search, dense search, structured DB, knowledge graph). Event-driven architecture provides clean interfaces for each data source.

4. **Fault Tolerance**: Financial applications require high reliability. Event-driven architecture with message queues provides built-in fault tolerance and retry mechanisms.

5. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new data sources, agents, or processing steps without major architectural changes.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Event Infrastructure
1. Set up message queue system (Redis/RabbitMQ)
2. Implement event bus and event handlers
3. Create CrewAI agent event adapters
4. Establish event schema and validation

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration Layer
1. Implement Query Orchestrator agent
2. Create Intent Analysis agent
3. Build Tool Selector agent
4. Set up agent communication protocols

### Phase 3: Data Source Integration
1. Implement sparse search event handlers
2. Create dense search event handlers
3. Build structured database event handlers
4. Set up GraphRAG event handlers

### Phase 4: Response Generation
1. Implement LLM integration with Anthropic
2. Create response fusion and ranking
3. Build response quality validation
4. Set up response delivery mechanisms
